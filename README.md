# retinal-gan
A generative adversarial network used to recreate retinal images for disease classification.

## Dataset
The set of retinal images comes from the STARE project: http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/

## Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of retinal images.
